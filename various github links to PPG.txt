************SOLUTION!:

Not sure if removing the AttributeTable from widgets folder or using the following after right clicking on sirgeo.github.io'Git Bash Here' ended up solving all errors (also had to do the step of Synchronizing ('Allow Access') when prompted for GitHub online and Desktop to connect:
*futher review seems to lean toward i simply forgot to hit PUSH after COMMIT in GitHub Desktop and removing the AttributeTable was the real fix.

Create a new repo in GitHub: https://GitHub.com/new

Copy the clone url, it ends with “.git”, use it in place of “URL” in commands below.

Open your Terminal and type these commands:

git init
git add .
git commit -m “initial commit”
git remote add URL origin
git push

Do not put 'index.html' into the url, just the folder's path:
https://sirgeo.github.io/Good_PPG_sans_AT/  <<<<<<< removed the ENTIRE AttributeTable folder from widgets folder and it runs with some limitations (Share widget throws errors, Basemap icons missing, etc.) Basemap icons were fixed by adding the png files into the folder where error shows they're missing
